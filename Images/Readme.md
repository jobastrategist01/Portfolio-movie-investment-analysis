## 🖼️ Visual Assets

The `/images` folder contains selected screenshots extracted from the Power BI report to showcase its visual structure and interactive features. These assets are ideal for documentation, presentations, or sharing previews without needing to open the `.pbix` file.

### 📄 Source Documents (PDF)

All images were extracted from the following Power BI exports, available in the [`/data`](./data) folder:

- [`Movie Analysis_Clean Filters.pdf`](./Data/Movie%20Analysis_Clean%20Filters.pdf)  
  Dashboard with **inactive filters** (broad dataset view across all years and budgets).

- [`Movie Analysis_Example Filters.pdf`](./Data/Movie%20Analysis_Example%20Filters.pdf)  
  Dashboard with **example filters applied** (realistic budget and year range), simulating an investment scenario.


### 📂 Structure

These visuals are intended to:

- Give a preview of the dashboard without opening Power BI
- Support documentation and publication of findings
- Help demonstrate the user experience and layout logic

> 📌 All visuals are for presentation purposes and reflect interactive components available in the `.pbix` file.
